About Project

This project was made by following Namsaste React Series by Akshay Saini


This is a front-end react project which uses live Swiggy APIS to fetch Data and show them. This project is build using Parcel.

The sole purpose of this project was to get familiar with react.

This project has taught me a lot of good industry standard practices from Naming, Folder Structuring to Testing of the Application and a lot more.

This helped me to learn hooks, routing in a react application, custom hooks and concepts like Controlled and Uncontrolled Components,
Higher Order Components and a lot more. 

This project also uses  Redux which helped me to understand how are we working with states at a global level.

Along with that, I got to know tailwind-css. 

Developer Testing which included unit testing and integration testing was done using react-testing-library which uses jest library.
